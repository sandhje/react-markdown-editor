# React markdown editor

Yet another markdown editor, this one created with React, Electron and coffee!

A lot of thing still need to be done to make this editor any good, e.g.:

* Add unit tests and jsdocs for all the "things"
* Open/Save functionality
* Timetravel (read: Ctrl-Z / Ctrl-Y)
* Multiple tabs
* Fixing layout issues
* Proper build and distibution processes (appveyor, travis, s3-hosted binaries and stuff like that)

If you have any suggestions, please let me know, e.g. on [gitter](https://gitter.im/sandhje/react-markdown-editor) or by [filing an issue](https://github.com/sandhje/react-markdown-editor/issues)
